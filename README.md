Hi all,
Today, I want to share my open-source project that is Led matrix controller based on ESP32 of Espressif manufacturer.

ESP32's specification:
32-bit MCU & 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi & Bluetooth/Bluetooth LE
Two or one CPU core(s) with adjustable clock frequency, ranging from 80 MHz to 240 MHz
+19.5 dBm output power ensures a good physical range
Classic Bluetooth for legacy connections, also supporting L2CAP, SDP, GAP, SMP, AVDTP, AVCTP, A2DP (SNK) and AVRCP (CT)
Support for Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE) profiles including L2CAP, GAP, GATT, SMP, and GATT-based profiles like BluFi, SPP-like, etc
Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE) connects to smart phones, broadcasting low-energy beacons for easy detection
Sleep current is less than 5 Î¼A, making it suitable for battery-powered and wearable-electronics applications
Peripherals include capacitive touch sensors, Hall sensor, SD card interface, Ethernet, high-speed SPI, UART, I2S and I2C

This board support various of LED Panel pin interface suchs as P5, P10,...
If you have any idea, feel free to comment below.
Thank you! ðŸ¥°
